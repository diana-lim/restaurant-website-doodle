          <p class="meal">Breakfast</p>
          <p>Our breakfast menu was inspired by our founder's experiences and exposure to cuisine from the land down under. Her favorite memories of breakfast are from Sydney, Australia with her host and chef mentor, Pam.</p>

          <p class="meal">Lunch</p>
          <p>"Eat like me, and you'll never have to go to the gym," says Diana. Our lunch menu was inspired by our founder's lazily productive, health-conscious lifestyle. Here, you'll find healthy, balanced, afternoon-friendly meals that'll help you power through the remainder of your work day.</p>

          <p class="meal">Dinner</p>
          <p>Dinner is in Cambodia. Just kidding... It's here at Lim's Kitchen. Our dinner menu was inspired by our founder's experiences with cuisine in the East. If she's tasted it, it's here. Or it will be some time in the year. </p>
